# Project 3: Analysing Flight Interconnected Data

## Data
The 2009.csv data file contains information of U.S. domestic airline flights in 2009. 
Each row represents a single flight and it includes information such as flight date, airline, flight number, origin and destination airports, scheduled and actual times,
delays, cancellation and etc.

The project's data is in cvs file named `2009.csv`. 

The full data file can be obtained via this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1trFtRCe3xPBLr90hIWBF__OqppEnJPR_/view?usp=sharing).

### Flight Interconnected Data

Example: XE

OP_CARRIER_FL_NUM: Flight number assigned by the carrier  
Example: 1204

ORIGIN: Departure airport code  
Example: DCA

DEST: Arrival airport code  
Example: EWR

CRS_DEP_TIME: Scheduled departure time  
Example: 1100

DEP_TIME: Actual departure time  
Example: 1058.0

DEP_DELAY: Departure delay in minutes. Negative if early  
Example: -2.0

TAXI_OUT: Taxi-out time in minutes (gate to takeoff)  
Example: 18.0

WHEELS_OFF: Time when wheels left the ground  
Example: 1116.0

WHEELS_ON: Time when wheels touched down  
Example: 1158.0

TAXI_IN: Taxi-in time in minutes  
Example: 8.0

CRS_ARR_TIME: Scheduled arrival time  
Example: 1202

ARR_TIME: Actual arrival time  
Example: 1206.0

ARR_DELAY: Arrival delay in minutes. Negative if early  
Example: 4.0

CANCELLED: Whether the flight was canceled (1.0 = yes, 0.0 = no)  
Example: 0.0

CANCELLATION_CODE: Reason for cancellation  
Example: A (Carrier)

DIVERTED: Whether the flight was diverted (1.0 = yes, 0.0 = no)  
Example: 0.0

CRS_ELAPSED_TIME: Scheduled flight duration in minutes  
Example: 62.0

ACTUAL_ELAPSED_TIME: Actual flight duration in minutes  
Example: 68.0

AIR_TIME: Time spent in the air (minutes)  
Example: 42.0

DISTANCE: Flight distance in miles  
Example: 199.0

CARRIER_DELAY: Delay caused by the airline  
Example: null or 15.0

WEATHER_DELAY: Delay caused by weather conditions  
Example: null or 10.0

NAS_DELAY: Delay caused by National Airspace System  
Example: null or 5.0

SECURITY_DELAY: Delay due to security reasons  
Example: null or 0.0

LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY: Delay due to a previous flight arriving late  
Example: null or 20.0

Unnamed: 27: Extra column with all values as null
